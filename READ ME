For Question 1:

Create the SortedPriorityQueue() object
Use the .add method to insert a key-value pair into the PQ
The .add method uses insertion sort to maintain the sorted PQ
The for loop prints out the order of the PQ

For Question 2:

Important:
Input must be a COMPLETE BINARY TREE

For example: You must input [1, null, 2, null, null, 3, null] in order to get an accurate traversal

"Done" is used as the breakaway from the while loop
